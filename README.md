## Comments

This was a fun assignment!  I'm still a little nervous about using the Git Bash command prompt; I feel like one wrong keystroke will bring it all crashing down... but I think I'll get more comfortable with it over time.  I apologize if I made too many commits; I tried to make one each time I made a noticeable change to my coding.
