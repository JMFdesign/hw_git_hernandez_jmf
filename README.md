## Comments

This was a fun assignment!  I'm still a little nervous about using the Git Bash command prompt; I feel like one wrong keystroke will bring it all crashing down... but I think I'll get more comfortable with it over time.  I apologize if I made too many commits; I tried to make one each time I made a noticeable change to my coding.

I did notice after I was a few commits in that I used the subject "first commit" rather than "initial commit" and I was not comfortable enough with the command prompt to try and edit the subject.  I will try to edit it on GitHub before submitting and will make sure to more closely follow the directions next time.
