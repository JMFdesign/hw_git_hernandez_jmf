            <p>I have always though that the size of an animal is directly proportional to their kind nature; the larger the animal, the more loving it is.</p>
            <p>As I [logically] cannot have an elephant or a giraffe as a pet, I have come to the conclusion that I will have to settle for one of the largest domesticated dogs known: the Great Dane.  While they can grow to a size and weight that rivals that of a full-grown man, they are one of the kindest, most gentile breeds.</p>
            <p>But be warned, there is power in their size and folly in their heaerts that can be a recipe for disaster. One misstep or gallumphing stride can overturn some of the largest pieces of furniture; let alone the unwitting passerby.</p>
